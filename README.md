# alchemyrecipes
Noita mod to show alchemy recipes

## Usage
Just look at the recipes. The `[<]` button minimizes the recipe
display. Click on the recipe itself to toggle between codenames
vs. localized names for the ingredients.

## Installation (Manual)
Get setup for mods (get on the modding tools beta branch). [Download
this repo as a .zip](https://github.com/probable-basilisk/alchemyrecipes/archive/master.zip), and extract into your `Noita/mods/` directory (so this README
should end up in `Noita/mods/alchemyrecipes/README.md`). Then enable
the 'Alchemy Recipes' mod through the in-game pause menu.

## Installation (Git)
You can git clone this repo directly into mods:
```
cd {your Noita install dir}/mods/
git clone https://github.com/probable-basilisk/alchemyrecipes.git
```
Then enable the 'Alchemy Recipes' mod through the in-game pause menu.
